Insertions require an encodable slider and a continuous screw
This project contains the software module for a 2D insertion comprising of a ClearLink-Teknic/THK slider and SMC pneumatic screw, + 4 suction pads

There are 4 BOOLs and 1 REAL to control motion of the insertion:
  up : BOOL
  down : BOOL
  in : BOOL
  out : BOOL
  target : REAL (default value = -1)

the 4 directional BOOLs control continuous motion
target commands the slider to a position >= 0

the 4 suction pads can be turned on individually or all at once

All drives have at least 3 modes - HOLD, IN, OUT - to store their direction of continuous motion
Encodable drives have an additional mode - TARGET - to store a target position

calling the methods of a drive changes its mode (and if applicable, its target position)
the drive will perform its task concurrently with the rest of the program
